# Cocktail Chatbot


The objective of our chatbot is to help the user in his search for a cocktail.

We used the Facebook developer messenger server and wit.ai for the NLP part.

We use the API of "thecocktaildb" which provides a list of cocktails of different specificity and the possibility of filtering according to different categories: alcoholic or non-alcoholic, based on a specific type of alcohol, etc ...

## How to use it :
Here is an example of communication with our chatbot:

-	Type "menu" to display the chatbot menu
-	Ask the question by using the words of the desired functionality.

Example: 

•	If you want: "Search a cocktail by name", you can write: "Tell me more about the Margarita cocktail".
•	Or if you want: "One of the most popular cocktails", you can write: "Give me a popular cocktail".
